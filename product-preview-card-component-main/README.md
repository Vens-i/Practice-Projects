## My process

I plotted down all the necessary elements of this component in HTML, this includes the image and the product information. I made sure to format this information in a way that would allow me to access them in styling. Then I proceeded to style from top to bottom. Then I tackled the mobile section by modifying some styled elements for a better visual experience on screens less than 375 pixels wide.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to utilize padding to get spacing and/or layout visually correct. Utilizing the flexbox layout property   I also continued learning how to use proper HTML semantics. Additionally, I have a better understanding on how to make layouts responsive according to media screen sizes.
